# Connect and travel with like minded people

We love traveling! We share experiences! We want to deeply connect! 

These are the derived mission statements from our shared Vision and some strategies

## Find like minded people with similar interests

- Choose/get to know your own interests
- Publish your interests and find other people by interests
- Open for all fields of interests
- Build deep and longlasting connections to people that share your passion

Travel can be very lonely. Where at home there is a constant circle of friends based around interests, frequent relocation seems to contradict deep and lasting friendships with common interests. 
We want to change that!

Deep and long-lasting connections usually develop when there is a common passion for a topic, for example paragliding. This passion can be combined very well with traveling. A passionate paraglider can explore the mountains of Nepal with other paragliders and thus find friends and travel partners even for further trips.

We assist in getting to know one's own interests and to find like minded people with the same passions. 

## Connect easily with like minded people at a certain location

- Connect to local communities and other travellers
- Discover most common interests at certain locations
- Easy searching for topics and/or locations
- Provide technical assets to make communication easy and meaningful

When you arrive in a new place, it can be difficult at first to find your way around and get to know other people. One strategy is to choose your destination based on existing communities and quickly connect with like minded people. Another strategy is to find people with common interests online and then choose a destination together. 

Both strategies lead to being in the right place with the right people. Connect to existing local and traveler communities in specific locations as well as find the right people for your trips. In particular, we want to facilitate and centralize communication about travel destinations and interests to enable sustainable community building.

## Enable people to travel

People are passionate about traveling, while often blocked and actually not traveling - or not as much as they would like to.
There are different reasons for not traveling, like a non-remote job, having kids or other responsibilities, or just no interest in traveling alone.

Some jobs are naturally non-remote, like chefs working in a restaurant or childcare in kindergarden. Our mission is to enable people to travel while working in their profession, as much as they want. 

If you have kids, wonderful. Traveling is more complicated, but wait, maybe you can find help by professional childcare travellers and even other families with kids. We want to help getting this sorted out easily for you.

Some people don't want to travel alone and we have the right travel partner for you, or maybe even more than one.

## Help people to travel more easily

Traveling can be complicated and a lot of work to prepare and plan. Especially when you travel alone and not traveling a lot, or do the planning for a whole group, or just to a unknown location.

Some people travel a lot and are really good at planning. We want to bring them together with everyone who struggles with planning and finding accomodations.

Traveling in groups needs more planning, but can also be a lot of fun. It should be easy to organize trips together, based on experience and the right tooling.

Discovering new locations is an adventure. Locals can guide and help, or all the valuable informations and tips can be available in the local travel community. Connecting to them boost your experience.
